Hi, welcome to my portfolio site for [claudemapara.com](https://www.claudemapara.com) built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

It's pretty simple what this is, a digital home that reflects how I think, build, grow and experiment with new things I wanna try! So, rather than treating this as a finished product, I see it as an ongoing story in design, engineering, and a lot of refactoring : )

Examine the code if you want. Ha! I'm slowly going through and commenting/cleaning things I hastily created.

Want to know how any particular thing was created or have any questions? You should [write me](mailto:claude.mapara@hotmail.co.uk) because I enjoy talking about this stuff.
